#### CountDown number game where user can give program some random numbers and target number and program have to figure out final number by using (+-*/) operators .

#### Here is small example of it in action .  In this instance, one number was selected from the large set, and the rest from the small set.

```
  { 50 , 8 , 3 , 7 , 2 , 10 }
  
  The randomly selected target was 556.
  
  There are multiple ways to solve this. The smallest solution requires just four numbers:
  
  (50 × 10) + (8 × 7) = 556

```
